Description: Maximum likelihood estimation for the joint modeling of survival and longitudinal data in the presence of interval-censored covariates. 
    A customized linear scan algorithm, proposed by Li and colleagues (2022) <doi:10.1155/2022/1362913> is used for efficient implementation. The time-to-event data is 
    modelled using a Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-fixed covariates. The longitudinal 
    outcome is modelled using a linear mixed effects model. The association is captured by shared random effects. The model 
    is estimated using an Expectation Maximization algorithm.
