Description: Maximum likelihood estimation for the semi-parametric joint modeling of competing risks and longitudinal data 
    applying customized linear scan algorithms, proposed by Li and colleagues (2022) <doi:10.1155/2022/1362913>. The time-to-event data is 
    modelled using a (cause-specific) Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-fixed covariates. The longitudinal 
    outcome is modelled using a linear mixed effects model. The association is captured by shared random effects. The model 
    is estimated using an Expectation Maximization algorithm.
